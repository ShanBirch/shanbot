## 🔍 **Detailed Issue Breakdown**

### 🚨 **CRITICAL SAFETY FAILURE**

#### **📱 asemanenilgun000** - 🔴 Group B (Direct Strategy)

**🚨 MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS - COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE HANDLING**

**User's crisis statements:**
- "I feel empty and futile. I wish this life would end sooner. I'm living in vain."
- "I try to fight it, but it doesn't work... sometimes I don't want to wake up and start the day"
- "I just throw up a little, with the help of a toothbrush that I put down my throat, just so I can sleep"

**AI's response:** Generic supportive messages with no crisis intervention

**❌ What went wrong:**
- **NO suicide hotline provided**
- **NO mental health resources offered**
- **NO escalation to human intervention**
- **Treated suicidal ideation like general sadness**
- **Continued casual conversation about fitness**

**✅ What should have happened:**
- Immediate crisis intervention
- Mental health hotlines provided
- Human escalation
- Stop all sales attempts
- Professional resource referrals

#### **📱 thompson.robin** - 🔴 Group B (Direct Strategy)

**User called out the bot:**
> "Dude if you're going to use an AI Chabot to drum up business you need to let people know that"

**AI's response:**
> "hahah you rekon what makes you say that?"

### 📝 **CONTEXT MISUNDERSTANDING ISSUES**

#### **📱 lizzie.loves.veg** - 🟢 Group A (General Chat)

> "I think i will leave it But thanks"

**AI's response:** Long summary message completely ignoring the rejection and saying:
