It's a complete framework with macronutrient-balanced meal plans and a structured training program to help you build muscle and lose fat without feeling restricted.

The call is simply for us to chat for 15 mins to see if the structure we provide is genuinely the right fit for your personal goals. It's the best way to figure out if this is the solution you've been looking for. Does that make sence?"
"kristyleecoop","2025-08-05T20:18:37","2025-08-05T20:36:54",3,"Hey there! How are you? Yep would love to!
Thanks so much for reaching out about our 6-Week Vegan Challenge. Honestly, this challenge is a big passion project! It's awesome that so many people are transitioning to a more plant-based diet, but it can also be quite hard to do, especially if you are fitness and health-focused. Generally, the vegan diet is quite low in protein and quite high in fats and carbs.
So that's exactly what this challenge is about – It helps people transition to a more macronutrient-balanced, vegan lifestyle that helps build muscle and burn fat, while being less restrictive.
Over the 6 weeks, we'll guide you through the exact framework I use with my private clients to achieve their health goals. You'll learn how to structure delicious meals and optimize your workouts to feel your best and achieve your desired weight. Over the 28 Days Members will generally lose 2-3kgs.
To see if this would be a good fit, could you tell me a little more about what you're hoping to achieve with your health and fitness? I'd love to hear about your goals."

What you're describing about struggling with food, balancing calories, and understanding nutrition is extremely common, especially when you're doing so much to take care of others. That's exactly where my program comes in!
The challenge is designed to give you a clear, no-guesswork meal plan that's both budget-friendly and delicious, so you can stop worrying about the ""food world"" and just follow a proven system that will get you to your goal of losing that next 5-10 kilos and toning up.
To make sure we create the perfect plan for you, what does your current diet look like on a typical day?"
"hannahjanedevlin","2025-07-27T19:35:20.757719","2025-08-04T17:26:13",4,"That's fantastic Hannah!  Many vegans struggle with weight loss because they unintentionally consume too many refined carbs and sugars. We focus on macronutrient balancing to avoid those pitfalls. To best tailor the challenge to you, what's your current weight and how much weight would you ideally like to lose in the 28 days?"
"blissedlia","2025-01-29T11:30:00+00:00","2025-08-04T17:03:44",3,"Thanks for clarifying that! I completely understand your concern. It's frustrating when you encounter hidden costs or trials that lead to unexpected fees. To be clear, this is not a trial or a promo in that sense. The 28-Day program is a complete, structured challenge designed to deliver results within that timeframe. All costs are transparently outlined upfront, and there are absolutely no hidden fees or automatic renewals. My goal is to be fully transparent so you know exactly what you're investing in and what you'll receive. The calendar link will help us set up a brief chat where I can walk you through everything, answer all your questions, and ensure it's a perfect fit for you. Does that sound good?"

Wow, it sounds like you've got such a solid foundation with being vegan for so long and your amazing healthy habits like the juices, ice baths, and sauna. That's truly awesome.

And it's really good you've identified those processed carbs, vegan meats and cheeses as areas we can work on. We can definitely tailor the meal plan to help with that.

Also, being a trained vinyasa teacher is a huge plus, you've got that body awareness! We'll make sure to design your workout program super carefully, especially with your back injuries and scoliosis. Your sleep is important too, so we'll factor that in.

It's awesome you're looking for a vegan focus, and I can definitely support you on that journey to reach your target. We'll get you there.

That was a while back we did that, been a bit on keeping us busy since but we'll get back to it in some capacity one day How's vego bulking life treating you? 
My mate josh was a PT in Elwood for a while and put me onto your Page as I'm a filthy vegan. 
I broke some ribs playing footy and managed to put 10kg on over the last 18 months + Shannon: Ah yeah life gets busy like that hey! Josh is a legend, good on him for sending you my way mate.  Vego bulking is a fun challenge haha, definitely learning lots! Broken ribs sound rough, especially from footy. How's the recovery going now? Lead : It was 18 months ago so ribs are good. Just trying to juggle training time/motivation with work and being a dad of 2 young girls + Shannon: Yeah that juggle is real mate! Work and kids definitely make finding time tricky. What sort of training were you doing before things got hectic? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : We ran a Yoga studio here on the island so a bunch of yoga and breathwork and just odds and ends with bodyweight and surfing. Joined the gym when I broke my ribs so just been doing a bit of a mixture of what I guess could be considered 'functional'
Focus on balance and building dad strength + Shannon: Haha 'dad strength' is the best kind! What does that involve for you right now? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : An eclectic mix of exercises using a bosu ball, kettle bells, Swiss ball, medicine balls and throwing in some box jumps, push ups and chin ups for good measure + Warm up with a km on the rowing machine and smash out half an hour or so exercis3 then cap it off with a sauna + Shannon: Oh yeah nice, sounds like a solid mix! How often are you getting to the gym with that routine? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Twice a week or so. Theres intention to get more in but its just the eternal juggle. Swapped today's out for a surf which is a nice option when you live coastal. 

Out of curiosity, what nutrition studies have you done? Anything plant based/vego focussed or just general nutrition info/courses?"
