What's your fav type of workout out of all of those? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Oh that\u2019s a tough question. Probably what I\u2019m not doing. \ud83d\ude05 I really like HIIT and circuits. \nWhat do you do for your groups classes? + Shannon: Yeah right HIIT and circuits are sick!  We do strength based classes mostly! What about you, do you train at a gym or at home? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s a tough question! \nI dance 3-4x a week and travel a lot for dance events. Cant get enough. \n\nHow long have you been coaching for? And I saw on your page that you\u2019re plant based? \ud83d\ude4c + Ok cool! \nI mainly train at home. But I\u2019m going to start coaching at a gym so I\u2019ll have access to more equipment. + Shannon: Yeah right plant based for life! Been coaching for over 10 years now haha. That's cool you gonna coach at a gym! What kinda gym? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s amazing! How beautiful to be helping others in their fitness journeys for so many years. \ud83d\ude4c \n\nThe gym I will be coaching at is a small boutique gym in the cities downtown area. + Shannon: Cheers! Yeah love it hey. Boutique gyms are cool, more personal usually. What style of coaching will you focus on? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Mainly one-on-one. Hopefully I have the opportunity to do some group classes too. + Shannon: Oh nice one on one coaching is awesome! Really get to know your clients! What are you most excited about with coaching? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Ya know, I used to be a personal trainer years ago. And I loved the relationships with my clients. Being a part of their journey meant a lot to me. I\u2019m excited to have another area of someone\u2019s health that I can help improve.\nAnd it will get me out of the kitchen here and there and into another community of amazing people. + What did you do before coaching? What got you down this path? + Shannon: Yeah right! So before coaching hey,  I was actually a bit of a chubby kid haha, always struggled with my weight growing up, especially being veggie and clueless about protein!  Then got into exercise and science and it just clicked. Totally agree about the client relationships tho, being part of their journey is awesome! Sounds like you're really passionate about that too which is rad! Lead : That\u2019s so cool you grew up eating a veg based diet tho. But once it clicks it\u2019s pretty amazing to start building a body. I\u2019m so glad you found what worked and used your own journey to now help others. Well done! \nI\u2019m excited to see where you grow from here. \n\nHonestly I was clueless about protein until very recently. \ud83d\ude48 \nIt only just clicked for me this year. + Shannon: Yeah right! What kinda coaching did you do before? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : I was a personal trainer for some private clients as well as  at a gym. All different ages and abilities. So I catered to each."

What about you, do you train at a gym or at home? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s a tough question! \nI dance 3-4x a week and travel a lot for dance events. Cant get enough. \n\nHow long have you been coaching for? And I saw on your page that you\u2019re plant based? \ud83d\ude4c + Ok cool! \nI mainly train at home. But I\u2019m going to start coaching at a gym so I\u2019ll have access to more equipment. + Shannon: Yeah right plant based for life! Been coaching for over 10 years now haha. That's cool you gonna coach at a gym! What kinda gym? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : That\u2019s amazing! How beautiful to be helping others in their fitness journeys for so many years. \ud83d\ude4c \n\nThe gym I will be coaching at is a small boutique gym in the cities downtown area. + Shannon: Cheers! Yeah love it hey. Boutique gyms are cool, more personal usually. What style of coaching will you focus on? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Mainly one-on-one. Hopefully I have the opportunity to do some group classes too. + Shannon: Oh nice one on one coaching is awesome! Really get to know your clients! What are you most excited about with coaching? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Ya know, I used to be a personal trainer years ago. And I loved the relationships with my clients. Being a part of their journey meant a lot to me. I\u2019m excited to have another area of someone\u2019s health that I can help improve.\nAnd it will get me out of the kitchen here and there and into another community of amazing people. + What did you do before coaching? What got you down this path? + Shannon: Yeah right! So before coaching hey,  I was actually a bit of a chubby kid haha, always struggled with my weight growing up, especially being veggie and clueless about protein!  Then got into exercise and science and it just clicked. Totally agree about the client relationships tho, being part of their journey is awesome! Sounds like you're really passionate about that too which is rad! Lead : That\u2019s so cool you grew up eating a veg based diet tho. But once it clicks it\u2019s pretty amazing to start building a body. I\u2019m so glad you found what worked and used your own journey to now help others. Well done! \nI\u2019m excited to see where you grow from here. \n\nHonestly I was clueless about protein until very recently. \ud83d\ude48 \nIt only just clicked for me this year."

(Similarly when we are pushing ourselves in a difficult workout and your mind gives you every reason to quit) So I feel it\u2019s in navigating those challenging times, and changing the words we speak internally, that will lead us somewhere greater. \nI really enjoy your page by the way. And so nice to connect from across the world. + Shannon: Yeah right! That's so true about the inner voice, can be a battle sometimes! Thanks for the kind words about the page :) Where are you based? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : In in South Dakota USA + Shannon: Oh wow, South Dakota!

I stay in Ubud and there\u2019s lots of yoga and ecstatic dance happening. + Shannon: Sounds like such a vibe over there! Especially Ubud. {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : If you get the opportunity to go I can\u2019t recommend it enough. + Shannon: Yeah right!

What's got you interested in Egypt? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : I love it! Perhaps not too far to get around from Au to some of these amazing places?\n\nOne of my best friends is from the Red Sea and has a home there I can stay at.

What about you, early riser or sleep in? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : I figured you must get good sleep if you lift. Recovery is key. \nI\u2019m an early riser. I love waking up early and getting  my workout in and feeling accomplished before others are even awake. + Shannon: Yeah right early workouts are the best!  What do you usually do for your morning session? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Kinda depends on the day of the week. I\u2019m doing 2 upper and 2 lower days, Zone 2 cardio and abs 2 days, and rest one. Sprinkle in some dance, yoga, and cycling. + Shannon: Sounds like a solid routine!

Redwood forest for snakes is wild haha! Do you walk around those areas often? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Haha yeah the seal was a bit of a surprise!!! Cool though. \nRedwood not very often.  Warburton is gorgeous though and has lots of tracks. \nI just like to trail walk in summer. \nHow about you? + Shannon: Yeah Warburton is stunning hey! Love getting outdoors for a walk myself, used to ride bikes everywhere on Tamborine Mountain growing up.  Any favourite tracks out Warburton way?  Lead : Yeah it\u2019s gorgeous.  \nOhhh where is Tamborine mountain!?\nUmmm\u2026 I don\u2019t actually. I usually just drive there and try and find somewhere to walk. \nI quite like the greens bush walk to bush rangers bay though.  That would be my favourite lately. + Shannon: Greens Bush walk is awesome hey! Tamborine Mountain is in QLD, near the Gold Coast. What do you like about Greens Bush walk so much? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Ohh I see.  Are you originally from qld?\nI like that it\u2019s not overcrowded or busy, the trail is gorgeous and it leads to the beach at the end! + Shannon: Yep, born and raised in QLD! Totally agree, less crowds and a beach finish is the best combo. What's the beach like at the end there? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Oh how cool! When did you move to Melbs?\nIt\u2019s not bad.  The waves are quite big and rough so not ideal to swim in but the rock pools are stunning"
