**Patterns and Concerns:**

* Good adherence to workouts and nutrition tracking at the beginning of the week, but it significantly decreases towards the end.
* Inconsistent walking tracking throughout the week.  This could just be that it wasn't tracked each day, and that data is available if it had been checked off.
* Weight loss is seen throughout the week. However, without other metrics, it is unclear what led to this weight loss.
