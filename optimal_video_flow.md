- Sets goals for next week
- Shows real progress with specific numbers

**SIMPLIFIED WORKOUT STATS AFTER:**
- General stats feel less redundant 
- Still shows total volume/effort
- Complements rather than competes with Progressive Overload

**REMOVES REDUNDANCY:**
- Old workout analysis was generic
- New AI analysis is specific and actionable
- No need for both approaches
