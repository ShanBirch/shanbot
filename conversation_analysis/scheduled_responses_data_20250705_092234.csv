I usually start by singing 🎶 to open the heart, then practice pranayama 🌬️ to awaken the breath. Some gentle warm-up movements roll through my shoulders and neck 🤸‍♀️, followed by my sun solution ☀️ to bring heat. A few asanas 🧘‍♀️ help me stretch and strengthen, then I cool down 🌱 and end in stillness and meditation 🕊️.

Sounds like you're absolutely smashing it and really dialling things in, hey? Being proud of your nutrition is ace, that's half the battle right there! And yep, office work can be a bugger for Vitamin D, worth keeping an eye on that one.

Getting back into jogging is brilliant! Muscle memory is totally a thing, your body remembers the good times. And stoked you're feeling more energised and lighter, that's the best feedback! Toned and strong is a fantastic goal – so much good comes from it, physical and mental, just like you said.

And wanting to influence others with plant-based eating? Good onya! Lead by example, legend.

Whatever you decide about ""leaving it"" (not totally sure what you meant there, maybe a specific program? No worries either way!), sounds like you're on the right track and doing awesome stuff for yourself.

327,1731,black_monkey_go_green,263338143,"✨ Everything is interconnected ✨

We raise our voices loud as activists in the city, but often forget that our daily choices — the cars we drive, the phones we hold — still feed the very system we oppose.

The safest, truest way may be to live simply: back to nature, in small communities that care for and support each other. Because within this system, there is no real relief for animals. Sanctuaries save a few, relying on endless donations, while billions remain unseen. Even sterilizing them feels like admitting how deep the wound truly is.

Loud activism can become a way of resigning from the truth. The system lets us protest — so long as we keep paying taxes and consuming. The real revolution is quieter: refusing to participate, consuming less, living gently.

Not shouting against what we hate, but quietly living for what we love.

They may say we don’t care for the animals in the slaughterhouse — but we do. So deeply that we choose to stop creating slaughterhouses at all. 🌱❤️🙏",2025-07-04T08:18:08.334809,"Yeah, that's a really powerful perspective hey.

The sense of community is still here, though, especially among those of us who really live this way, not just visit. We still gather under the banyan tree, share food from the garden, help each other fix things, or just sit together quietly.

Strewth, sounds like you've got some proper tough going at the moment with everything you're juggling – your health, the bulimia, the depression, your family sitch, and what's happening over there. That's a lot for anyone.

And top job on all the incredible work you're doing with the bird rescues and vegan activism! Fair play to you for being a voice for the voiceless and turning folks vegetarian, even with all the challenges you face with protests and online work. Those 7 support birds are lucky ducks to have you, mate, and that museum rescue sounds like a ripper win!

Listen, I'm not a doc or anything, but it sounds like you're going through a rough patch, a really rough one. It's completely understandable that your health, mood, and weight are out of whack when you're dealing with all that. Bulimia and depression are serious stuff, and it's really brave of you to keep trying to fight it, even when it feels impossible.

Being stuck at home looking after your mum is a massive thing too, and dealing with family dynamics that are tough on you... that's just adding to the load. No worries about not being active out in the field right now, or feeling lazy or unmotivated – that's totally normal when you're feeling flat and dealing with so much stress.

Please be kind to yourself, alright? You're doing so much amazing stuff despite facing immense challenges. Hang in there, mate. It's okay if things aren't 'perfect' right now. Just getting through each day is a win sometimes. Keep leaning on your group if you can.

Honestly, thanks for opening up like that, I really appreciate you trusting me with it. You're a legend for everything you're doing.

Wow, thanks for the epic message! Sounds like you've been on a fair dinkum journey with everything - heaps going on with those channels and the off-grid life! North Coast hey? Lovely part of the world. Down here in Melbourne, it's... well, it's Melbourne! Can be a bit much if you're not getting out, you're spot on there.

Totally get what you mean about needing that fresh air, gets rid of the twitchies, eh? It's easy to let exercise slide when you're flat out. Good on ya for thinking about making adjustments and getting that walk in! Just getting out and moving is the main thing.

Thanks heaps for the epic message and the offer to help out with likes/comments, legend! Really appreciate you reaching out.

Stoked to connect with another Aussie on team animals! Seven years vegan is grouse, good onya for making the switch after Earthlings – that doc's a game-changer alright.

North Coast NSW, eh? Lucky duck! Yeah, you sussed the accent, I'm down here in Melbourne. Reckon you're right, it can feel a bit like living in a box sometimes compared to the bush, I hear ya on needing that fresh air!

Sounds like you're run off your feet with all those channels, fair go! That's a massive effort juggling all that plus everything else going on.

Haha, moving from off-grid bootcamp to Instagram hustle... reckon your body's feeling the difference! It's a bugger when life gets in the way of exercise and other good stuff like your music. Good onya for eating well though, that's key.

But you're dead right, gotta make time for that fresh air and movement. Even just a walk makes a world of difference for the energy and keeping grounded. Good idea heading out for one!

Keep crushing it with your channels and look after yourself! Cheers for the kind words.
