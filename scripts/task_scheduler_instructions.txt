   C:\Users\Shannon\OneDrive\Desktop\shanbot\scripts\run_instagram_bot.bat
9. Click Next, then Finish

10. Find your new "Instagram Bot" task in the Task Scheduler Library
11. Right-click on it and select "Properties"
12. On the General tab, check "Run whether user is logged on or not"
13. Check "Wake the computer to run this task"
14. Under the Conditions tab, check "Wake the computer to run this task"

Your Instagram bot will now run automatically at 8:00 PM every day until it processes the entire list of followers. The script already has logic to keep track of which users it has processed, so it will continue from where it left off each day.

If you need to run the script manually at any time, you can right-click on the task in Task Scheduler and select "Run".
