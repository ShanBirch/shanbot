PLANT-BASED NUTRITION GUIDE

Understanding Plant-Based Protein & Macro Balancing

Most plant proteins come bundled with either carbohydrates (legumes, grains) or fats (nuts, seeds). Hitting targets is 100% doable – it just needs smart choices:

Protein Sources

Focus on protein-dense options first: tofu, tempeh, seitan, TVP/soy mince, high-protein pasta, and fortified soy yogurt. Use a clean plant protein powder when convenient.

Macro Control

• Use protein isolates (powers) for grams without extra carbs/fats.<br/>• Choose high-protein product swaps (e.g., protein pasta vs standard).<br/>• Combine foods across the day to cover amino acids (grains + legumes).<br/>• Use a simple protein powder when convenient for grams without extra carbs/fats.<br/>

Iron (non-heme)

Prioritise chickpeas, lentils, beans, tofu/tempeh, spinach and pumpkin seeds. Add vitamin C at meals (capsicum, lemon, berries) to boost absorption. Avoid tea/coffee 60 minutes around iron-rich meals.<br/>

Vitamin B12

Use fortified foods (soy milk, nutritional yeast) and a reliable B12 supplement (weekly or daily) to maintain levels.<br/>

Omega-3 Strategy

Daily ALA from flax, chia and hemp. For direct DHA/EPA, add an algal oil supplement (vegan). This supports brain, mood and endurance.<br/>

Additional Notes for Vlad:

• Focus on spicy, varied plant-based meals with fermented foods.<br/>
• Prioritize high-protein options to support body recomposition goals.<br/>
• Hydration is key, especially with high activity levels.

<br/>
<b>Why track?</b> Learning portion sizes and macro values gives you the knowledge to make smart substitutions and enjoy more food freedom while staying on track with your goals.<br/>
<br/>
<b>SMART SUBSTITUTIONS</b><br/>
Feel free to make equivalent swaps:<br/>
• <b>Proteins:</b> Tofu ↔ Tempeh ↔ Beans ↔ Lentils (similar amounts)<br/>
• <b>Grains:</b> Jasmine Rice ↔ Basmati Rice ↔ Red Rice ↔ Black Rice ↔ Quinoa ↔ Pasta (similar portions)<br/>
• <b>Vegetables:</b> Any similar vegetables work great<br/>
• <b>Aim for similar calories</b> to maintain your targets<br/>
<br/>
<b>MEAL TIMING (APPROXIMATIONS)</b><br/>
The suggested meal times are <b>approximations</b> - adjust to fit your lifestyle:<br/>
• <b>Why timing helps:</b> Regular meal patterns support energy levels, hunger management, and metabolism<br/>
• <b>Not overly important:</b> Your total daily intake matters more than exact timing<br/>
• <b>Pre-workout:</b> Have your snack 30-60 mins before training for energy<br/>
• <b>Post-workout:</b> Include protein within 2 hours after training for recovery<br/>
• <b>Listen to your body:</b> Adjust timing based on your hunger, energy, and schedule<br/>
• <b>Sunday:</b> Flexible reset day - eat intuitively<br/>
<br/>
<b>SHOPPING & PREP TIPS</b><br/>
• Use the weekly shopping list provided<br/>
• <b>Batch prep:</b> Cook grains, chop vegetables, and prepare proteins ahead<br/>
• <b>Sunday prep:</b> 1-2 hours of prep sets you up for success<br/>
• <b>Storage:</b> Most meals keep 3-4 days in the fridge<br/>
<br/>
<b>SUCCESS TIPS</b><br/>
• <b>Be consistent</b> - aim for 80% adherence rather than 100% perfection<br/>
• <b>Plan ahead</b> - look at your week and prep accordingly<br/>
• <b>Listen to hunger</b> - adjust portions slightly based on your activity<br/>
• <b>Stay hydrated</b> - aim for 2-3L water daily<br/>
• <b>Ask questions</b> - your coach is here to support you!
