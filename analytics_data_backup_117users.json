Josh is a legend, good on him for sending you my way mate.  Vego bulking is a fun challenge haha, definitely learning lots! Broken ribs sound rough, especially from footy. How's the recovery going now? Lead : It was 18 months ago so ribs are good. Just trying to juggle training time/motivation with work and being a dad of 2 young girls + Shannon: Yeah that juggle is real mate! Work and kids definitely make finding time tricky. What sort of training were you doing before things got hectic? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : We ran a Yoga studio here on the island so a bunch of yoga and breathwork and just odds and ends with bodyweight and surfing. Joined the gym when I broke my ribs so just been doing a bit of a mixture of what I guess could be considered 'functional'\nFocus on balance and building dad strength + Shannon: Haha 'dad strength' is the best kind! What does that involve for you right now? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : An eclectic mix of exercises using a bosu ball, kettle bells, Swiss ball, medicine balls and throwing in some box jumps, push ups and chin ups for good measure + Warm up with a km on the rowing machine and smash out half an hour or so exercis3 then cap it off with a sauna + Shannon: Oh yeah nice, sounds like a solid mix! How often are you getting to the gym with that routine? {{cuf_11967919}}  {{cuf_11967920}} Lead : Twice a week or so. Theres intention to get more in but its just the eternal juggle. Swapped today's out for a surf which is a nice option when you live coastal. \n\nOut of curiosity, what nutrition studies have you done? Anything plant based/vego focussed or just general nutrition info/courses?"
